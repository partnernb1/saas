    <p class="mb-4">A dangerous heat wave continues to scorch much of the United States this week, with more than 100 million people currently under heat advisories or warnings. Temperatures in many areas are expected to exceed 100°F (38°C), with heat indices making it feel even hotter.</p>

    <p class="mb-4">The National Weather Service has issued excessive heat warnings across states from Texas to New York. In several regions, overnight temperatures will remain high, offering little relief from the heat. Cities like St. Louis, Nashville, and Philadelphia are experiencing extreme conditions that may pose serious health risks, particularly for young children, the elderly, and those without access to air conditioning.</p>

    <p class="mb-4">Authorities urge residents to stay indoors during the hottest hours of the day, remain hydrated, and check on vulnerable neighbors and family members. Local cooling centers have been opened in several cities to provide refuge from the heat.</p>

    <p class="mb-4">This heat wave is part of a broader trend of intensifying summer temperatures and is putting strain on energy grids, emergency services, and healthcare facilities. Officials continue to monitor the situation and provide updates as conditions evolve.</p>
